=========
Dripper:
=========
A Jabber client completely written in Scala.
Uses the Smack API from IgniteRealTime.

Reasons
=======
Biggest reason was a project to get better at Scala with.
Second biggest reason was I wanted a lot more simple of a pure Jabber client
that allows for better resource and priority management.
As well as having a small nifty little plugin Manager and look pretty.
