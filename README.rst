Dripper:
=========
A Jabber client completely written in Scala.
XMPP support from Barkety.
 - Convenient roster management.
 - Supervision Heriarchy ready.
 - and actor-level isolation of state management.

Reasons
=======
Biggest reason was a project to get better at Scala with.
Second biggest reason was I wanted a simple pure Jabber client
that allows for better resource and priority management.
As well as having a small nifty little plugin Manager and look pretty. ^_^
